                                <b>Abstract :</b>
                                This project involves redesigning the Blackboard site’s content in order to make it easier to navigate for its users.This project also involves applying web content management principles learnt in this course, to redesign the site utilizing XML, HTML and
                                Site: blackboard.syr.edu

                                <b>Rationale for the choice:</b>
                                We have decided to Re-engineer the main blackboard site, the rationale behind this choice was two fold. The first being that as students we have all had issues with the blackboard site we would like to improve upon. Secondly because everyone in this class has access to the blackboard site we believe our project can stir up meaningful conversations and discussions about the site.Blackboard being very extensive platform we chose Courses page and Notifications.

                            </p>

                                <b>Background of Site:</b>
                                Blackboard is a content management site that can facilitate a virtual learning environment. It can support various courses and can utilizes various forms of media (pdf, embed links, videos, chat forums, and groups etc) to aid personalize the learning environment.It serves as a platform for students to access all course materials, assignment submissions, grades, weekly announcements etc.It allows course instructors to post the course content, provide course related updates, and accept assignment submissions. It also provides a list of all organizations associated with Blackboard, which allows students to acquire information about the courses being offered at other colleges. It is maintained and managed by ITS (Information Technology Services).

                                <b>Preliminary Evaluation:</b>
                                A non-personalized blackboard page, in other words many students find that their initial dashboard isn't personalized well, it includes links they never use such as links to previous classes and features on blackboard.
                                The dashboard has tabs is very cluttered

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <b>Recommendations for site improvements :</b>
                                By default Filtering the site to only showing active courses (not previous semester courses) to aid the user quickly find their current class. Better categorization of the dashboard to encapsulate more relevant content, in order to limit excessive information on the page.
                                Removing tabs such as Goals & Assessments will declutter the dashboard and reduce the maintenance efforts by ITS
